      <h3>Apple I, 1976</h3>

Priced at $666.66, Apple's first computer was little more than a circuit board. Once you bought one, you still had to hook up your own keyboard, monitor and power supply. As such, the Apple appealed mostly to the DIY hardware hackers of the day, who had these things on hand already.</p>

      <h3>Apple II, 1977</h3>
      <img src="https://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/images_blogs/gadgetlab/2011/10/apple_II_01.jpg" class="img-responsive ap1"/>
      <p class="info">
        The company hit the jackpot one year later with 1977's Apple II, a fully assembled desktop computer in a handsome case. Hackers still took to it because of its expandability. More importantly, schools used it to teach programming (it ran Integer BASIC) and offices started snatching them up once VisiCalc launched on the nascent platform.</p>

      <h3>Macintosh, 1984</h3>
      <img src="https://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/images_blogs/gadgetlab/2011/10/apple_macintosh_02.jpg" class="img-responsive ap1"/>
      <p class="info">
        The Macintosh arrived in 1984, and it was the first computer to successfully integrate two things that are now commonplace: a graphical user interface and a mouse. Little pictures of folders, the piece of paper denoting a file, the trash can — most of us learned how all of these things worked when we sat down at the Mac. Drag-and-drop, too.
Apple launched the Macintosh with a massive media campaign spearheaded by a minute-long TV commercial (riffing on Orwell's 1984) that aired during the Super Bowl.

      <h3>Next, 1988</h3>
      <img src="https://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/images_blogs/gadgetlab/2011/10/next_computer_f.jpg" class="img-responsive ap1"/>
      <p class="info">
        NeXT's most famous workstation was an austere black cube — Jobs constantly pushed his designers to experiment with innovative case constructions throughout his career — that cost $6,500. It was fast and especially adept at math functions, and it had a built-in Ethernet port in an age when most computers still needed a network interface card. Tim Berners-Lee used one to write the first web server and the first web browser. The first server node on the World Wide Web was a NeXT box.

      <h3>IMAC, 1998</h3>
      <img src="https://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/images_blogs/gadgetlab/2011/10/apple_imac_03.jpg" class="img-responsive ap1"/>
      <p class="info">
        After NeXT failed to gain traction, Jobs sold the company to Apple and came back into the fold in 1996. Two years later, the company released a complete rewrite of the desktop PC — the candy-colored iMac. It kicked the boring beige PC box to the curb, and it marked the return of the revolutionary all-in-one design first introduced by the original Macintosh. The first iMac was a runaway hit, and the all-in-one design is still used by today's iMac (and widely copied by other PC manufacturers).

      <h3>IPod, 2001</h3>
      <img src="https://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/images_blogs/gadgetlab/2011/10/apple_ipod_04.jpg" class="img-responsive ap1"/>
      <p class="info">
        The first iPod was a $400 MP3 player with a 5-gigabyte hard drive and a mechanical scroll wheel that didn't sync to Windows machines. Not a very likely candidate for the device that would completely change the music industry. The iPod's all-white design was minimalist compared to other players that came before and, more importantly, the user interface was remarkably easy for anyone who picked it up to figure out.

        <h3>Mac OS X, 2001</h3>
        <img src="https://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/images_blogs/gadgetlab/2011/10/apple_osx_05.jpg" class="img-responsive ap1"/>
        <p class="info">
          When Steve Jobs returned to Apple, he ordered a rethink of the Mac's native operating system. Of course, he pushed for NeXTSTEP — the Unix-based OS he developed independently and sold to Apple in 1996 — to serve as the blueprint.Eventually surfacing in 2001, Mac OS X was a complete departure from earlier Mac operating systems and, as Jobs had promised, a true "next generation" OS. It appealed to novices fluent in Windows (enabling the craze of "switching") but it retained enough of its Unix guts and enough of Apple's well-established interface conventions to keep the Apple geeks interested.

        <h3>Iphone, 2007</h3>
        <img src="https://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/images_blogs/gadgetlab/2011/10/apple_iphone_07.jpg" class="img-responsive ap1"/>
        <p class="info">
          During his keynote address at Macworld 2007, Jobs said Apple would announce three things: "A widescreen iPod with touch controls, a revolutionary mobile phone and a breakthrough internet communications device. An iPod, a phone and an internet communicator." Of course, it was all three of those things in one — the iPhone.Years on, Apple's phone has not only completely changed our expectations of how a smartphone should look, feel and behave, but Jobs' famous wrangling with the wireless carriers has toppled the long-standing power structure in the industry.Before Apple, carriers insisted on controlling the hardware and software on their phones. Now, if they want the hottest phones, the carriers have to play ball.
